Data Collection and Pre-Processing Lab Assignment

Hello there! I'm Eris, and welcome to my Lab2 - Data Collection and Pre-processing Jupyter Notebook! So, what exactly are we diving into today? That's a great question!
We're about to explore the absolutely essential first steps in any machine learning journey: data collection and pre-processing. Think of it like this: raw data is usually pretty messy â€“ full of errors, missing bits, or just not in a format a computer can easily understand. 
For this lab, we've picked two interesting datasets from the e-commerce and U.S. government sectors. Our main tasks will be to load them up, give them a thorough cleaning to get rid of any quirks, and then summarize them so we can understand what we're working with.
